# Day 4: Prompt Engineering in Go

Welcome to Day 4! Today we'll master the art and science of prompt engineering - the crucial skill that determines how effectively your AI agents communicate and perform tasks.

## üéØ Learning Goals

- Understand prompt engineering principles and best practices
- Learn different prompting techniques and patterns
- Implement dynamic prompt generation systems
- Build reusable prompt templates
- Create context-aware prompting strategies
- Optimize prompts for specific tasks and domains

## üìñ Theory: The Art of Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing inputs to get desired outputs from language models. It's both an art (creativity, intuition) and a science (systematic testing, measurement).

### Core Principles

1. **Clarity**: Be specific and unambiguous
2. **Context**: Provide relevant background information
3. **Structure**: Use consistent formatting and organization
4. **Examples**: Show the model what you want (few-shot learning)
5. **Constraints**: Set clear boundaries and guidelines

### Common Prompting Techniques

#### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting
Direct instruction without examples:
```
"Translate the following English text to French: [text]"
```

#### 2. Few-Shot Prompting
Provide examples to guide the model:
```
Example 1: English: "Hello" ‚Üí French: "Bonjour"
Example 2: English: "Goodbye" ‚Üí French: "Au revoir"
Now translate: English: "Thank you" ‚Üí French: ?
```

#### 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
Guide the model through step-by-step reasoning:
```
"Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, identify the problem
2. Then, break it down into components
3. Finally, provide the solution"
```

#### 4. Role-Based Prompting
Assign specific roles or personas:
```
"You are an expert Go programmer. Review this code and suggest improvements..."
```

#### 5. Template-Based Prompting
Use structured templates for consistency:
```
Task: [TASK]
Context: [CONTEXT]
Requirements: [REQUIREMENTS]
Output format: [FORMAT]
```

## üíª Today's Implementation

We'll build a comprehensive prompt engineering system with:

### 1. Prompt Template Engine
- Dynamic template processing
- Variable substitution
- Conditional logic
- Template inheritance

### 2. Prompt Library
- Pre-built templates for common tasks
- Domain-specific prompts
- Multi-language support
- Version management

### 3. Prompt Optimization Tools
- A/B testing framework
- Performance metrics
- Automatic refinement
- Quality scoring

### 4. Context Management
- Conversation history integration
- Dynamic context selection
- Memory-aware prompting
- Adaptive context sizing

## üß™ Hands-on Labs

### Lab 1: Basic Prompt Templates
Build a template system for generating dynamic prompts.

### Lab 2: Advanced Prompting Techniques
Implement chain-of-thought and few-shot learning patterns.

### Lab 3: Domain-Specific Prompts
Create specialized prompts for coding, writing, and analysis tasks.

### Lab 4: Prompt Optimization
Build a system to test and improve prompt effectiveness.

## üéØ Prompting Strategies by Use Case

### Code Generation
```
Role: Expert Go developer
Task: Generate clean, efficient code
Context: [requirements, constraints]
Output: Well-commented Go code with error handling
```

### Data Analysis
```
You are a data analyst. Analyze the following data and provide:
1. Key insights
2. Trends and patterns
3. Actionable recommendations
Format: Structured report with clear sections
```

### Creative Writing
```
Write a [type] about [topic] in the style of [style].
Consider:
- Target audience: [audience]
- Tone: [tone]
- Length: [length]
- Key themes: [themes]
```

### Problem Solving
```
I have a problem: [problem description]

Please help me solve it using this approach:
1. Clarify the problem
2. Identify possible solutions
3. Evaluate each option
4. Recommend the best approach
5. Provide implementation steps
```

## üîß Advanced Techniques

### 1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection
Automatically select the most relevant examples based on the current task.

### 2. Adaptive Prompting
Adjust prompting strategy based on model responses and task complexity.

### 3. Multi-Turn Conversation Design
Design prompts that work well in conversational contexts.

### 4. Error Recovery Prompting
Handle cases where the initial prompt doesn't produce desired results.

## üìä Prompt Evaluation Metrics

1. **Accuracy**: Does the output match expectations?
2. **Consistency**: Are outputs stable across similar inputs?
3. **Relevance**: Is the response on-topic and useful?
4. **Completeness**: Does it address all aspects of the request?
5. **Efficiency**: Token usage vs. output quality

## üöÄ Best Practices

### Do's
- Be specific and concrete
- Use examples when possible
- Test with edge cases
- Iterate and refine
- Document successful patterns
- Consider token efficiency

### Don'ts
- Be overly verbose without purpose
- Use ambiguous language
- Ignore context limitations
- Assume model knowledge
- Skip testing and validation

## üìù Key Concepts Learned

1. **Template Systems**: Structured, reusable prompt generation
2. **Context Management**: Intelligent information selection
3. **Technique Application**: When and how to use different methods
4. **Optimization**: Systematic improvement of prompt effectiveness

## üîÑ Next Steps

Tomorrow we'll build on prompting skills to create:
- Advanced context management systems
- Long-term conversation memory
- Intelligent context selection
- Persistent conversation state
