# Day 2: LLM Integration Basics

Welcome to Day 2! Today we'll dive deeper into Large Language Model (LLM) integration and learn about different providers, model selection, and optimization techniques.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Understand different LLM providers and their APIs
- Learn about model selection and trade-offs
- Implement token management and cost optimization
- Handle streaming responses
- Implement retry mechanisms and error handling
- Build a more sophisticated AI client

## 📖 Theory: LLM Landscape

### Major LLM Providers

1. **OpenAI**
   - GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo
   - Best for general tasks, reasoning
   - Higher cost, excellent quality

2. **Anthropic**
   - Claude models
   - Great for safety, analysis
   - Good reasoning capabilities

3. **Open Source Models**
   - Llama 2/3, Mistral, Code Llama
   - Self-hostable, cost-effective
   - Varying capabilities

### Model Selection Criteria

- **Task Complexity**: Simple vs complex reasoning
- **Cost**: Token pricing and usage patterns
- **Latency**: Response time requirements
- **Context Length**: How much text you need to process
- **Specialized Capabilities**: Code, math, languages

## 💻 Practical Implementation

Today we'll build a more sophisticated LLM client that supports:
- Multiple providers
- Streaming responses
- Token counting and cost estimation
- Retry mechanisms
- Response caching

### Key Features

1. **Provider Abstraction**: Easy switching between LLM providers
2. **Cost Tracking**: Monitor API usage and costs
3. **Streaming**: Real-time response delivery
4. **Caching**: Reduce API calls for similar queries

## 🧪 Hands-on Labs

### Lab 1: Multi-Provider Client
Build a client that can switch between OpenAI and Anthropic.

### Lab 2: Token Management
Implement token counting and cost estimation.

### Lab 3: Streaming Chat
Build a streaming chat interface with real-time responses.

### Lab 4: Response Caching
Add intelligent caching to reduce API costs.

## 🔧 Advanced Features

- **Retry Logic**: Handle rate limits and temporary failures
- **Request Batching**: Optimize multiple requests
- **Context Window Management**: Handle long conversations
- **Model Fallbacks**: Automatic fallback to different models

## 📝 Key Concepts

1. **API Rate Limits**: Understanding and handling limits
2. **Token Economics**: Cost optimization strategies
3. **Response Quality**: Evaluating model outputs
4. **Error Patterns**: Common failure modes and solutions

## 🚀 Performance Tips

- Use appropriate models for tasks
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor token usage patterns
- Use streaming for better UX
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
