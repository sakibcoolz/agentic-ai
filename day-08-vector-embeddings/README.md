# Day 8: Vector Databases & Embeddings

Welcome to Day 8! We're starting Week 2 focused on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. Today we'll learn about vector databases, embeddings, and how to store and retrieve information semantically.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

- Understand vector embeddings and semantic search
- Learn about different vector database options
- Implement embedding generation with OpenAI
- Build a basic vector store
- Perform semantic similarity searches
- Design data ingestion pipelines

## ðŸ“– Theory: Vector Embeddings

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Similar concepts have similar vectors, enabling semantic search.

### Key Concepts

1. **Embeddings**: Dense vector representations of text
2. **Similarity**: Cosine similarity, dot product, Euclidean distance
3. **Dimensionality**: Common sizes: 384, 768, 1536 dimensions
4. **Vector Databases**: Specialized storage for high-dimensional vectors

### Popular Vector Databases

- **Pinecone**: Managed cloud service
- **Weaviate**: Open-source with rich features
- **ChromaDB**: Simple, local-first option
- **Qdrant**: High-performance Rust-based
- **FAISS**: Facebook's similarity search library

## ðŸ’» Implementation

Today we'll build:
- Embedding generation system
- Simple in-memory vector store
- Semantic search functionality
- Document ingestion pipeline

## ðŸ§ª Labs

### Lab 1: Generate Embeddings
Create embeddings for different types of text.

### Lab 2: Vector Store
Build an in-memory vector database.

### Lab 3: Semantic Search
Implement similarity search functionality.

### Lab 4: Document Ingestion
Build a pipeline to process and store documents.
