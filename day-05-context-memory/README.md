# Day 5: Context Management & Memory

Welcome to Day 5! Today we'll build sophisticated memory systems that allow AI agents to maintain context across conversations, remember important information, and provide more intelligent, contextual responses.

## üéØ Learning Goals

- Understand different types of memory in AI agents
- Implement conversation history management
- Build context-aware response generation
- Create persistent memory storage systems
- Optimize context window usage
- Design memory retrieval strategies
- Handle long-term conversation state

## üìñ Theory: Memory in AI Agents

Memory is what transforms a simple chatbot into an intelligent agent. It enables continuity, personalization, and contextual understanding across interactions.

### Types of Memory

#### 1. Short-Term Memory (Working Memory)
- Current conversation context
- Recent message history
- Active task state
- Temporary variables and context

#### 2. Long-Term Memory (Persistent Memory)
- User preferences and profile
- Historical interactions
- Learned facts and relationships
- Domain knowledge and expertise

#### 3. Episodic Memory
- Specific conversation episodes
- Event sequences and timelines
- Context-dependent experiences
- Temporal relationships

#### 4. Semantic Memory
- Factual knowledge
- Concepts and relationships
- General rules and patterns
- Domain expertise

### Memory Challenges

1. **Context Window Limits**: LLMs have finite input length
2. **Information Decay**: Older context becomes less accessible
3. **Relevance Filtering**: Not all information is equally important
4. **Storage Efficiency**: Balancing detail with performance
5. **Retrieval Speed**: Fast access to relevant memories

## üíª Today's Implementation

We'll build a comprehensive memory management system with:

### 1. Conversation Memory Manager
- Message history tracking
- Context summarization
- Sliding window management
- Priority-based retention

### 2. Persistent Memory Store
- User profile management
- Long-term fact storage
- Relationship tracking
- Knowledge base integration

### 3. Context Optimization
- Intelligent context selection
- Dynamic summarization
- Relevance scoring
- Token budget management

### 4. Memory Retrieval System
- Semantic search in memories
- Temporal filtering
- Importance weighting
- Multi-modal memory access

## üß† Memory Architecture Patterns

### 1. Sliding Window Memory
```
[Message 1] [Message 2] [Message 3] [Message 4] [Message 5]
                     ‚Üì Slide window ‚Üì
           [Message 2] [Message 3] [Message 4] [Message 5] [Message 6]
```

### 2. Hierarchical Memory
```
Recent Context (Full Detail)
    ‚Üì
Medium-term Summary (Key Points)
    ‚Üì
Long-term Knowledge (Facts & Patterns)
```

### 3. Episodic Memory Structure
```
Episode: "User asks about Go programming"
- Timestamp: 2025-01-15 14:30
- Context: Learning web development
- Key Topics: [goroutines, channels, web servers]
- Resolution: Provided code examples
- Follow-up: User implemented successfully
```

## üîß Context Management Strategies

### 1. Token Budget Management
- Allocate tokens between history and response
- Prioritize recent and relevant context
- Compress older information
- Dynamic context sizing

### 2. Relevance Scoring
- Semantic similarity to current query
- Temporal proximity weighting
- User importance indicators
- Topic continuity factors

### 3. Summarization Techniques
- Progressive summarization
- Key point extraction
- Dialogue state tracking
- Contextual compression

## üß™ Hands-on Labs

### Lab 1: Basic Conversation Memory
Implement a simple conversation history manager with sliding windows.

### Lab 2: Context Summarization
Build intelligent summarization to compress long conversations.

### Lab 3: Persistent User Memory
Create a system to remember user preferences and facts across sessions.

### Lab 4: Semantic Memory Retrieval
Implement memory search based on semantic similarity.

### Lab 5: Advanced Context Optimization
Build a system that dynamically optimizes context for each query.

## üìä Memory Metrics & Optimization

### Key Metrics
- **Context Utilization**: % of context window used effectively
- **Retrieval Accuracy**: Relevant memories found/total relevant
- **Response Coherence**: Consistency with conversation history
- **Memory Efficiency**: Storage used vs. information value
- **Retrieval Speed**: Time to access relevant memories

### Optimization Strategies
- **Lazy Loading**: Load context only when needed
- **Caching**: Store frequently accessed memories
- **Compression**: Efficient storage of historical data
- **Indexing**: Fast retrieval through proper indexing
- **Garbage Collection**: Remove irrelevant old memories

## üîÑ Context Window Management

### Dynamic Context Selection
```go
func SelectOptimalContext(query string, history []Message, budget int) []Message {
    // 1. Score all messages for relevance
    // 2. Apply temporal decay
    // 3. Select messages within token budget
    // 4. Ensure coherent conversation flow
}
```

### Progressive Summarization
```go
func ProgressiveSummarization(messages []Message) Summary {
    // 1. Group messages by topic/time
    // 2. Create hierarchical summaries
    // 3. Preserve key facts and decisions
    // 4. Maintain conversation thread
}
```

## üöÄ Advanced Memory Techniques

### 1. Memory Consolidation
- Move important information from short to long-term memory
- Identify patterns and frequently accessed information
- Compress similar memories
- Create knowledge graphs from conversations

### 2. Contextual Memory Activation
- Activate relevant memories based on current context
- Use embedding similarity for memory retrieval
- Weight memories by recency and importance
- Support multi-hop memory associations

### 3. Adaptive Context Sizing
- Dynamically adjust context window based on task complexity
- Allocate more space for complex reasoning tasks
- Reserve space for system prompts and instructions
- Balance history with response generation needs

## üìù Best Practices

### Memory Design
1. **Layered Architecture**: Separate short-term and long-term memory
2. **Efficient Storage**: Use appropriate data structures
3. **Fast Retrieval**: Index memories for quick access
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle memory limits gracefully
5. **Privacy Consideration**: Secure sensitive information

### Context Management
1. **Relevance First**: Prioritize relevant over recent
2. **Preserve Continuity**: Maintain conversation flow
3. **Fact Consistency**: Ensure consistent information
4. **User Agency**: Allow users to correct/update memories
5. **Transparent Operation**: Users should understand memory use
